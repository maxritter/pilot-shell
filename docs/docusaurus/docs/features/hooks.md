# Hooks Pipeline

Lifecycle hooks enforce quality automatically throughout **Claude Code** workflows and connect Pilot's context and memory lifecycle to **Codex**. They are registered in `~/.claude/settings.json` for Claude Code and `~/.codex/hooks.json` for Codex CLI and ChatGPT desktop's Codex runtime. The tables below show which hooks apply to each agent.

Hook guidance is private by default: quality, routing, context, and maintenance findings go to the agent as operational context without a user-facing warning. A hook blocks only for an explicit unavailable Pilot workflow, an active workflow's approval or completion contract, an incompatible `/spec` entry state, or a pre-mutation attempt to edit generated `CLAUDE.md`. License recovery and those pre-mutation denials are the only technical conditions surfaced directly to the user.

Claude Code receives that private guidance with output suppression. Codex tool events receive `additionalContext` without `systemMessage`; Pilot deliberately omits `suppressOutput` there because current Codex releases reject it on PreToolUse and PostToolUse.

Pilot installs and updates its lifecycle integrations as one managed set. The tables below describe the user-relevant behavior of that pipeline.

Codex runs the skill refresh, session registration, memory observer, and turn summarizer as native asynchronous command hooks. Repository synchronization, workflow guards, active-work recovery, and SessionEnd remain synchronous because their result must be observed before the lifecycle event completes. Pilot does not register an MCP hook merely as a transport substitute; an MCP handler belongs here only when an installed server owns a concrete lifecycle operation and returns the hook contract directly.

## SessionStart

*On startup, after `/clear`, or after compaction*

| Hook | Applies to | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `session_announcements.py` | Claude Code | Delivers one-time announcements and re-injects them until acknowledged. |
| `config_dir_guard.py` | Claude Code | Privately tells the agent when the active Claude configuration directory differs from the installed profile; it is surfaced only if the mismatch actually prevents the requested work. |
| `session_startup_maintenance.py` | Claude Code | Cleans stale Claude task files and dead PID-backed session directories. |
| `codegraph_init.py` | Claude Code | Initializes CodeGraph for the current project. |
| Skill sync | Both | Refreshes managed skills for the active agent. |
| Repository asset sync | Both | Silently synchronizes project rules and skills. A bounded scoped-rule index is supplied to the agent as suppressed context without printing in the session UI or hook-status log. |
| Worker context bootstrap | Claude Code | Restores the memory digest and active session context through the Console worker. Codex retrieves relevant cross-session memory on demand through `mem-search`. |
| `post_compact_restore.py` | Both | Re-injects active plan and task state after compaction. |
| `session_clear.py` | Both | Resets Pilot session state after `/clear`. |

## UserPromptSubmit

*When you send a message*

| Hook | Applies to | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `spec_mode_guard.py` | Claude Code | Warns outside bypassPermissions, blocks manual plan mode, and applies the configured `/spec` model-switching checks; Manual/Off modes have no model gate. |
| Session initializer | Both | Registers the session with the Console worker. |

## PreToolUse

*Before Bash, search, or web tools run*

| Hook | Applies to | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `tool_redirect.py` | Claude Code | Privately nudges recursive Bash, built-in search, and web calls toward the preferred indexed/MCP tools without denying the original operation. It also reminds the agent when a shell command edits a project file (`sed -i`, heredocs or redirects into a file, `tee`, inline scripts that write files) that changes belong in `Edit`/`Write`, where they show as a diff. Writes to `/tmp` and the scratchpad get no reminder. |
| `tool_token_saver.py` | Both | Rewrites eligible Bash commands through RTK for 60–90% smaller output. |
| `plan_mode_tracker.py` | Claude Code | Tracks `/spec` plan-mode state, records who owns the plan-mode leg being entered (the only moment `/spec` and native plan mode are distinguishable), verifies the observed planning-leg model, and reports the result once per leg. |

## PermissionRequest *(Claude Code only)*

*When a tool call would show a permission dialog*

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `auto_approve_plan.py` | Acts only on a `/spec` planning leg: allows `ExitPlanMode` there as the model-switch lever (and denies it while the registered spec plan still awaits approval). Claude Code's own plan mode is left alone — the plan-approval dialog is the user's, so the hook prints no decision and the plan is never approved on their behalf. It also restores `bypassPermissions` after a `/spec` plan exit — and only there: current Claude Code builds drop the session to `acceptEdits` or manual mode, so when the session was observed in bypass before the planning leg, the hook re-applies bypass on the first permission request that follows. In native plan mode the same choice is the user's own (`auto-accept edits` vs `manually approve edits`), so it is left untouched |

## PostToolUse

*After file edits, reads, and searches*

| Hook | Applies to | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `plan_mode_tracker.py` | Claude Code | Tracks entry to and exit from Claude Code plan mode for `/spec`. |
| `native_plan_capture.py` | Claude Code | Files a plan approved in Claude Code's own plan mode into `docs/plans/` as `Status: SAVED`, `Type: Plan`, so it renders in the Console instead of vanishing into a scratch file. Skipped whenever a `/spec` or `/build` run already owns the plan. |
| `file_checker.py` | Claude Code | Runs the existing edit-time lint/format checks and TDD reminder. |
| `context_monitor.py` | Claude Code | Tracks context use and privately nudges the agent as compaction approaches. |
| Memory observer | Both | Saves decisions, discoveries, and bugfixes. |
| Repository asset sync | Both | Silently reconciles supported edits across the Claude Code and Codex project-asset trees. Temporarily incomplete multi-file updates are deferred and retried instead of blocking an edit that already landed. |

## PreCompact

| Hook | Applies to | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `pre_compact.py` | Both | Snapshots active work before compaction so the next SessionStart can restore it. |

## Stop

*When the agent finishes*

| Hook | Applies to | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `spec_stop_guard.py` | Both | Holds a registered `/spec` or `/build` open until its completion rules are met. Honors the user-initiated discussion pause (`/spec pause`, or the agent pausing when you question a decision mid-run) so discussion turns aren't blocked. |
| Repository asset sync | Both | Verifies parity silently and repairs safe drift automatically. Incomplete edits are already returned to the agent as private context; an unresolved maintenance error never blocks completion or creates a user-facing warning. |
| Session summarizer | Both | Saves the turn's durable observations. |

`spec_plan_validator.py` runs as a command-scoped Stop hook during the `/spec` planning phases, holding the turn open until the run's plan file exists. It is satisfied by **this session's own** registered plan, so a plan another session is working on in the same directory does not release your planning run. Without a registration it falls back to scanning for a plan dated today, skipping any file another session has registered — see [Registering a plan](plan-format#registering-a-plan).

## SessionEnd

| Hook | Applies to | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `session_end.py --session-end` | Both | Completes the real session, waits for the team-memory export attempt, then stops the Console worker only when no other session remains. Codex now uses its native SessionEnd event rather than treating every Stop as a session boundary. |

:::info Compaction resilience
When a client emits the compaction lifecycle: **PreCompact** captures active state → compaction runs → **SessionStart** restores it via `post_compact_restore.py`. Codex's experimental context manager separately preserves notes and searchable thread history; Pilot does not automatically inject its memory digest into Codex.
