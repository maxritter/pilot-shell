# Claude Code vs Codex

Pilot Shell supports both agents. Claude Code has broader platform integration; Codex works for daily development with fewer platform-specific features. Pilot works with Codex CLI and with the Codex runtime bundled in the ChatGPT desktop app on macOS.

Direct requests, each agent's native Plan/Goal tools, and Pilot workflows are peer ways to work. Choose the contract you want; Pilot keeps its available context, quality, memory, and tools around all of them.

## Works on Both

All Pilot workflows run on both agents. Use `/` on Claude Code and `$` on Codex:

- **Structured workflows:** `/prd`, `/spec`, `/build`, `/fix`
- **Focused workflows:** `/investigate`, `/cleanup`, `/benchmark`, `/setup-rules`, `/create-skill`; Open Claude Design and Impeccable load automatically for matching visual work
- Console — all 11 views, persistent memory, sessions, and memories shared between agents
- Lifecycle hooks, compaction recovery, SessionEnd finalization, and workflow stop guards
- Workflow quality gates on both agents; Claude Code additionally keeps its edit-time lint, format, type, and TDD hooks
- MCP servers (CodeGraph, Semble, mem-search, web-search, and more)
- Rules, standards, context optimization, and team memories
- Spec-review and changes-review agents

Pilot installs the same five Open Claude Design skills for both agents. For the real Claude Design service, `open-claude-design` supplies the cross-platform CLI bridge; `pilot design` remains a forwarding alias. Claude Code is not required for authentication: the first desktop use connects in a browser, while headless containers use `pilot design login --manual` in an interactive terminal. See [UI Design and Claude Design](../workflows/ui-design.md).

## Claude Code Only

- **Status line** — real-time session metrics below every response
- **Pilot Bot** — scheduled tasks and background automation
- **Remote control** — connect from the Claude app / browser, plus channels (Telegram, Discord, iMessage)
- **Language Server integration** — LSP-driven diagnostics, hover docs, and go-to-definition (Codex uses repository lint/type commands during verification rather than an edit-time file-checker hook)
- **Model switching** — `/model` command to change models mid-session (Codex sets model via `codex --model` or `config.toml`)
- **`/effort ultracode`** — Claude Code's additional whole-project orchestration mode
- **Permission modes** — `Shift+Tab` cycle and Auto Mode classifier (Codex uses `approval_policy` in `config.toml`)
- **Codex companion reviews** — OpenAI adversarial review launched from within Claude Code
- **Team-sharing of extensions** — push/pull of `~/.claude/` extensions through a git remote
- **Commands** — slash-command extensions in `.claude/commands/` (Codex has no command primitive)

Claude's native LSP can strengthen exact reference checks during `/cleanup`; Codex combines repository analyzers with CodeGraph, Semble, and exact search. Neither path treats a missing LSP or graph edge as proof that code is unreachable.
