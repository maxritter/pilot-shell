The Plan is the one document you approve before any code is written. It puts the proposed change, key decisions and open issues first. A small change keeps this brief; larger changes include the design detail you need to review.

## What you read {#items}

The page shows the sections in the order of `03-plan.md`, so the file, the Reader and the page tell the same story.

| Part | What it tells you |
| --- | --- |
| **Summary** | The change in a few lines, with the size of the build, whether it is risky and what reviewed it |
| **Done means** | The results from [Discuss](discuss.md), and how each will be checked |
| **The artifact** | A wireframe or finished artifact for anything people see ([Artifacts](../artifacts.md)) |
| **Today and after the change** | A view of the change when it makes the proposal clearer |
| **Engineering decisions** | The consequential choices and their reasons, with a diagram where it helps |
| **Not doing** | What stays untouched |
| **Decisions made for you** | Your agent's smaller choices, with reasons |
| **Assumptions** | What the Plan takes for granted |
| **Before the build** | What must be ready first, such as a login |

Artifacts, wireframes and diagrams are never collapsed, so you approve what you can see. Risks, your earlier answers, assumptions, review findings and design contracts fold below them, each with a one-line summary. Both levels show the same sections; Product uses plainer words ([two levels](../intro.md#two-levels)). Patterns to follow and the proof gathered before approval stay in the document.

### What to read first {#read-first}

Start with **Look here**, under the summary. Each line names its first item and how many there are, and jumps to it:

- a risky concern
- an assumption or decision the agent is unsure of
- the trust boundary, when the Plan names one

Unresolved or unknown review findings stay visible. A recorded research source does not mean the Plan review is complete.

## Approve or give feedback {#answering}

A choice that only appears once an artifact is drawn is a **Your call**. **Your turn** shows them one at a time, with the part of the Plan each concerns, and each answer reaches your agent immediately. Findings from the technical review return to the planning agent; only a new hard choice reaches you.

1. Read the complete Plan.
2. Pin comments, or press **Give feedback**. Your agent revises; the diff shows what changed.
3. Press **Approve Plan** at the top right. It approves the Plan, **Done means** and the artifact together.

Answering a question does not approve the Plan. Approve in the App or give an explicit approval through your agent.

## Comment on a diagram {#diagrams}

Click any part of a diagram or passage to pin a comment. Your agent reads it when it next checks the task; a stopped or disconnected agent cannot answer yet. Teammates can comment too ([Plan reviews](../team/plans.md)).

## Before it reaches you {#before-it-reaches-you}

Your agent rereads every Plan as a reviewer would. A risky Plan also gets a separate review by an installed agent you choose in [Settings](../reference/settings.md#second-opinion).

While a required review runs, an amber reason sits beside the blocked **Approve Plan** button. Hover or focus the button to read why. It unlocks once required findings and human choices are settled.

Next: [Start Implement](implement.md#start-implement). The build session writes the [Outline](outline.md), then builds it.
