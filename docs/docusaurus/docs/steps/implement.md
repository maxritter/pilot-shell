## Start the build {#start-implement}

After you approve the Plan, **Start the build** appears on that Plan page. Choose where the agent runs and, with **In the App**, the agent, model, effort and branch for this build. The card opens with your last choice.

| On the card | What it picks |
| --- | --- |
| **Where the agent runs** | **In the App** (recommended) or **In my terminal**, according to the local runtime’s capabilities |
| **Agent** | An installed native agent, or Another agent for your terminal |
| **Model and effort** | The choices for this run |
| **Branch** | **Current branch**, **New branch** or **New worktree** |

Press **Approve & start**, or **Approve & copy prompt** with **In my terminal**.

- **In the App**, the task's **Agent** conversation opens beside **Files** and **Feedback**. Every question and piece of feedback happens in the App.
- **In my terminal**, the copied prompt says `implement the approved task` and names it. The agent asks its questions and takes your feedback in its own chat.

Closing the sidebar or switching tasks keeps the run. Use its session controls to stop or return to it ([agent runs](../app.md#agent-runs)).

### Where the build lands {#where-it-lands}

Under **Branch**, choose:

- **Current branch**
- **New branch**
- **New worktree**, which takes a name that sets its folder and branch. QualityLayer puts the folder next to your project.

A new branch or worktree starts from this checkout’s HEAD. The pull request target is shown separately, and a pull request needs a branch different from its target. `qualitylayer branch new [name]` creates a task branch from the terminal. A push or deployment requires the Plan’s authorization; merging remains yours.

One agent session builds the cards of the Outline in their order, the way it would work on its own. Each task starts with a failing test, then the smallest change that makes it pass. The session fixes what fails itself and commits with Git. For slices that do not depend on each other it can use its own agent's subagents; nothing requires it.

Test runs the session makes through QualityLayer are recorded with their commit and exit code. The reviewer in [Verify](verify.md) can cite them as evidence.

Follow the slice board to see what is running and what is finished. **Look here** highlights anything only you can supply. Open the recorded checks for their output.

Routine choices appear under **Decided while building**. When reality differs from what you approved (a new task, a changed contract or decision), the session records a visible amendment instead of changing it quietly; Review lists each one. Outline, Implement and Verify continue without workflow questions until Review.

A login, secret, account or other human-only prerequisite is recorded with the affected task and stays unverified for Review. Available work continues; blocked checks retain their evidence instead of being marked passed. The App never takes the secret.

Runs start with the agent's own permission settings. You can switch to another of its [permission modes](../agents/native.md#permission-modes) in the row under the message box; a mode that skips every check asks you to confirm. Native permission or sign-in prompts still require their normal response. An explicit stop or pause remains in force.

## When the build is done {#when-done}

The session decides when the build is ready, and Verify starts on what it committed. Cards still unticked and needs still open reach Review as open items. They never count as passed.
