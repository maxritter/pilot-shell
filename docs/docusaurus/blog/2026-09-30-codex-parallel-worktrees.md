Parallel sessions are useful when their work is independent. Separate checkouts help keep that independence visible in the files and evidence.

<!-- truncate -->

OpenAI's worktree documentation explains how managed worktrees separate agent work from a local checkout. It also distinguishes application-managed worktrees from ones you create with Git yourself. [Official worktree guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/environments/git-worktrees).

## Give each session a bounded task

Good separation begins with the work, not the directory. Decide which session owns a change, which files it may edit and what information it needs from the others.

Two agents editing the same core module need coordination even in separate checkouts. Two independent changes can often proceed with much less coordination.

Avoid parallelizing a task just because it can be divided. Count the cost of startup, context transfer, integration and review.

## Choose the checkout deliberately

Use the worktree controls supplied by your Codex environment when they fit the task. For a manual Git workflow, consult the [Git worktree reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) and choose a distinct branch and directory.

A worktree isolates repository files. It does not automatically isolate services, ports, databases or a shared generated binary. Those resources need their own ownership.

Before starting, identify:

- the base revision;
- the commands and dependency setup;
- any shared output path;
- the service ports and test data;
- the person or session responsible for integration.

These are setup decisions, rather than evidence that the task is complete.

## Keep cross-session messages small

Send the fact the other session needs: a changed interface, completed prerequisite or failed check. Include the relevant revision or file when it makes the message actionable.

A delivered message proves delivery. It does not prove the recipient implemented the requested change. Match the completion report to the task before proceeding.

QualityLayer's [session bridge](/docs/reference/commands#session-messaging) supports Claude Code and Codex in both directions. It can coordinate independent sessions without forwarding their whole conversations.

## Integrate with evidence

When a task returns, inspect its diff and verification result. Re-run checks when integration changes the code or its environment; do not repeat unchanged checks merely to produce another green line.

Keep the acceptance criteria intact. A merge conflict should not become an excuse to quietly simplify what the task promised.

QualityLayer's [Handoff](/docs/workflow/build/handoff) can recommend a new worktree when another task is building in the same checkout. The final [Review](/docs/workflow/check/review) stage still shows the combined change and evidence.

## Close the worktree carefully

Keep the task's useful records before cleaning up its checkout. Follow the environment's worktree lifecycle rather than assuming every worktree has the same storage or cleanup rules.
