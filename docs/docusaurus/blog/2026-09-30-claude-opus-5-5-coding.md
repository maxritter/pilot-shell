Claude Opus 5.5 is available, but a model announcement does not decide which model should build your next change. A useful evaluation starts with your repository and an acceptance check.

<!-- truncate -->

Anthropic introduced Opus 5.5 on September 22, 2026 and positions it for complex coding and extended agent work. That is a reason to evaluate it, rather than evidence that it will outperform another model on every task in your codebase. [Anthropic's announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-5-5).

## Compare completed changes

Pick a small set of representative tasks: one ordinary feature, one bug with a clear reproduction and one change involving a difficult boundary. Give each run the same base revision, requirements and available tools.

For example, an export task might be accepted only when its CSV preserves the screen's filters, contains the expected headers and handles an empty result. These checks make a comparison more useful than judging how confident each answer sounds.

| Record | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Accepted behavior | A shorter run is useful only if it solves the task |
| Failed and repeated checks | Shows where the run spent its effort |
| Human corrections | Exposes misunderstandings that a final test count may miss |
| Model and effort | Makes the comparison reproducible |
| Time and usage | Lets you compare the cost of an accepted result |

This is an evaluation plan, not a benchmark result. Run it before drawing a conclusion.

## Control effort separately

Opus 5.5's documented API default is medium effort. Its migration guide also describes changes to thinking configuration and tool selection. An API migration therefore deserves more than replacing a model ID. [Opus 5.5 migration guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/models/opus-5-5/migration-guide).

For an existing coding-agent setup, confirm the model and effort actually selected by that runtime. Record them with the result. Comparing one model at its default and another at a higher setting can answer a different question from the one you intended.

Avoid changing the model, prompt, test environment and permissions together. When a result changes, you need to know which change caused it.

## Keep the plan stable

An approved plan makes model comparison easier. The builder receives the same decisions, task boundaries and expected result, while the model supplies the implementation.

QualityLayer's [Outline](/docs/steps/plan) and [Handoff](/docs/steps/implement#start-implement) separate those responsibilities. Its current Claude Code handoff recommends Sonnet 5.5 for ordinary planned builds; Opus remains an explicit alternative. The available recommendation is a product choice, not a claim that a larger model is unnecessary.

If a build fails, inspect the failure first. A missing requirement needs a clearer plan. A broken test environment needs repair. A reasoning failure may justify a different model or effort. Those are separate interventions.

## Make the default follow the evidence

Keep the model that gives you reliable accepted changes at an acceptable cost. Preserve the evaluation tasks so you can run them again when your repository or agent changes.
