  {
    question: "Which spec-driven development tool is best?",
    answer: "Choose by the work you need to coordinate. Spec Kit offers customizable processes; OpenSpec manages evolving change proposals; HumanLayer coordinates shared agent work; Kiro integrates specs into its environment. QualityLayer emphasizes visual planning, human approval and recorded outcome evidence. This guide compares documented capabilities, not benchmark scores.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do these tools work inside Claude Code and Codex?",
    answer: "QualityLayer, HumanLayer's portable RPI skills, Spec Kit and OpenSpec all support Claude Code and Codex. Kiro documents its own agent environment, including an IDE and CLI. Agent compatibility alone does not distinguish QualityLayer; compare how a tool handles planning, verification evidence and human review.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I verify AI generated code against a spec?",
    answer: "Define observable acceptance criteria, run the relevant project checks and exercise the behavior those criteria describe. Record what passed, failed or could not be checked. QualityLayer's Verify and Review steps carry that evidence to human approval; independence depends on task risk and settings. Spec Kit, OpenSpec and Kiro also document implementation checks.",
  },
