# The 3-Category Backlink Strategy for SaaS Founders

Categorize backlinks by purpose: traffic-driving, SEO authority, and no-follow. Plus submission strategies and link exchange tactics.

Not all backlinks serve the same purpose. The difference between wasting months on low-value submissions and building real domain authority comes down to categorizing links correctly and prioritizing accordingly.

This framework breaks backlinks into three categories based on their actual function, then covers the three pricing models for directory submissions—including a live backlink exchange section at the end.

## [The Three Categories of Backlinks](#the-three-categories-of-backlinks)

### [1. Traffic-Driving Submissions](#1-traffic-driving-submissions)

Backlinks from platforms where users actively discover products. The SEO benefit exists but is secondary—these drive actual visitors.

**Examples:**

- Product Hunt, BetaList launches
- SaaS directories: Capterra, G2, GetApp
- AI directories: There's An AI For That, Futurepedia
- Niche-specific directories in your vertical

**Identification:** Real search functionality, active user bases, category browsing. If people use the site to find tools, it's traffic-driving.

### [2. SEO Authority Backlinks (Dofollow)](#2-seo-authority-backlinks-dofollow)

Foundational links that boost domain authority without sending meaningful traffic. These signal legitimacy to Google.

**Examples:**

- Startup listings: Crunchbase, AngelList, F6S
- Business directories (industry-specific)
- Profile backlinks: GitHub, Dribbble, LinkedIn company pages
- Curated resource pages and "best tools" lists

**Identification:** Check for `rel="nofollow"` in the HTML. No attribute = dofollow by default. MozBar or similar extensions speed this up.

### [3. No-Follow Backlinks](#3-no-follow-backlinks)

Links with `rel="nofollow"` that don't pass direct authority. Often dismissed, but that's shortsighted.

**Examples:**

- Social profiles (Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram bios)
- Forum engagement (Reddit, Indie Hackers, Hacker News)
- Blog comments on relevant articles

**Why they matter:** Google's 2019 update treats nofollow as a "hint" rather than directive—they may still influence rankings. More importantly, a profile with 100% dofollow links looks manipulated. Natural link profiles include nofollow.

## [The Three Submission Pricing Models](#the-three-submission-pricing-models)

### [Completely Free](#completely-free)

Most directories accept free submissions. Trade-off: slower approval, less visibility, often lower DR.

**Approach:** Batch submit to 20-30 free directories using curated lists like the [Awesome SEO Backlinks repo](https://github.com/indie-hacking/Awesome-SEO-Backlinks). Complete profiles fully—logos, descriptions, screenshots accelerate approval.

### [Paid Submissions ($9-$49)](#paid-submissions-9-49)

Premium placement, faster approval, higher-authority sites.

**Worth it for:**

- Launch platforms with real audiences (Product Hunt Ship, BetaList featured spots)
- High-DR directories (50+) where organic placement takes months
- Time-sensitive launches

**Skip:** Directories under DR 30 or those accepting everyone. You're paying for exclusivity—if it doesn't exist, neither does the value.

### [Free with Badge/Link Exchange](#free-with-badgelink-exchange)

Directories offering free listings in exchange for displaying their badge or adding a reciprocal link on your site.

**Evaluation criteria:**

- Their DR should significantly exceed yours for the exchange to be worthwhile
- Badge placement should fit naturally (Partners page, Featured On section)
- Avoid homepage clutter—dedicated pages work better

This is also how direct backlink exchanges work between SaaS founders. You link to them, they link to you. The section below facilitates exactly that.

*Here are a few websites and directories that implement submissions with link/badge verfication.*

- [TurboZero](https://turbo0.com/item/claude-fast)
- [Wired Business](https://wired.business)
- [Findly](https://findly.tools/claude-fast?utm_source=claude-fast)
- [Fazier](https://fazier.com)
- [Foundrlist](https://foundrlist.com/)

## [Execution Framework](#execution-framework)

**Phase 1: Foundation:**
Submit to 20-30 free directories across all three categories. Prioritize traffic-driving submissions first—they compound both SEO and user acquisition.

**Phase 2: Strategic Investment:**
Identify 5-10 paid directories worth the spend. Layer in forum engagement for nofollow diversity.

**Phase 3: Ongoing:**
Maintain 2-4 quality backlinks monthly. Shift toward guest posts and editorial links as DR increases past 20-30.
