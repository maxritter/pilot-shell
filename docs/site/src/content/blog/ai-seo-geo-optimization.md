# AI SEO & GEO: Get Your Content Cited by ChatGPT & Perplexity

Learn GEO to get cited by ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity. Traditional SEO is dying. Here is what replaces it for AI-first discovery.

**Problem**: Your content ranks on Google but ChatGPT never cites it. You're invisible to the AI assistants your users actually ask.

Traditional SEO is dying. By 2026, search traffic drops 25%. By 2028, it drops 50%. ChatGPT alone handles 10 million queries daily—more than Bing. When users ask AI assistants for answers, your competitors get cited. You don't.

Here's your 2-minute quick win:

```p-4
# Check if you're indexed in Bing (powers ChatGPT, Copilot)
site:yourdomain.com
```

Search that in Bing. See results? Good start. See nothing? You're invisible to every AI assistant that uses Bing's index. That's ChatGPT, Copilot, and Perplexity.

## [What is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)](#what-is-geo-generative-engine-optimization)

GEO optimizes content to be **cited** by AI assistants, not just ranked on Google. When someone asks ChatGPT "What's the best way to deploy Next.js?", you want your content referenced in the answer.

The difference from traditional SEO:

- **SEO goal**: Get a click to your website
- **GEO goal**: Become the answer AI assistants cite
- **SEO metric**: Search rankings and traffic
- **GEO metric**: Citation rates and reference frequency

ChatGPT doesn't care about your meta descriptions or backlinks. It cares whether your content provides clear, structured answers that LLMs can parse and cite.

## [Why This Matters for Claude Code Users](#why-this-matters-for-claude-code-users)

If you're building with [Claude Code](/blog/guide/what-is-claude-code), you're already thinking in AI-native terms. The same principles that make you effective with Claude apply directly to GEO:

- **Structured content**: Claude responds best to clear, well-organized instructions. So do AI search engines parsing your content.
- **Context optimization**: You manage [context windows](/blog/guide/mechanics/context-management) when coding. GEO is essentially context optimization for LLM consumption.
- **Automation at scale**: Your [agent workflows](/blog/guide/agents/agent-fundamentals) can generate GEO-optimized documentation automatically—a massive advantage over manual SEO.

## [How to Optimize Content for AI Citations](#how-to-optimize-content-for-ai-citations)

**1. Structure for AI Comprehension**

AI assistants prefer content that's easy to parse. Use clear headings, lists, and definitions:

```p-4
## What is [Topic]
 
[Topic] is [clear one-sentence definition].
 
### Key Benefits
 
- Benefit 1: [specific outcome]
- Benefit 2: [measurable result]
- Benefit 3: [clear advantage]
```

This structure helps LLMs extract and cite your content accurately.

**2. Get Indexed Fast with IndexNow**

Google crawls slowly. ChatGPT and Perplexity use Bing's index, which supports IndexNow—instant indexing.

[ShowUpInAI](https://showupinai.com/) automates this:

```p-4
# What ShowUpInAI does automatically:
1. Crawls your site daily for changes
2. Detects updated content instantly
3. Submits to Bing via IndexNow (indexed in minutes)
4. Monitors how AI assistants perceive your pages
```

Without automation, you wait weeks for Bing to crawl you. With ShowUpInAI, your content updates appear in ChatGPT/Perplexity responses within hours. Plans start at $14.99/month for 500 pages.

**3. Test Your AI Visibility**

Check what AI assistants actually say about your content:

```p-4
# Prompt for ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity:
"What are the best tools for [your topic]? Include sources."
```

Do they cite you? If not, your content isn't GEO-optimized yet.

## [Common GEO Mistakes](#common-geo-mistakes)

**Mistake 1: "My Google ranking is #1, so I'm good"**

Google rankings don't transfer to AI citations. ChatGPT doesn't see your Google position—it sees Bing's index and evaluates content authority independently.

**Fix**: Focus on content depth and structure, not keyword density. AI assistants reward comprehensive answers, not SEO tricks.

**Mistake 2: "I'll just wait for AI to find my content"**

Bing's crawl schedule is unpredictable. Your content update might wait 3-6 weeks before AI assistants see it.

**Fix**: Use [ShowUpInAI](https://showupinai.com/) for automatic IndexNow submissions. Your changes go live in minutes, not weeks.

## [What You Just Learned](#what-you-just-learned)

Traditional SEO is declining—GEO is replacing it. Here's what you now know:

- AI assistants cite content, they don't rank it
- Bing's index powers ChatGPT, Copilot, and Perplexity
- IndexNow gets you indexed 100x faster than waiting for crawls
- Content structure matters more than keywords

**Next steps**:

- Test your current AI visibility with the prompt above
- Check your [configuration basics](/blog/guide/configuration-basics) to see how Claude Code can auto-generate GEO-optimized docs
- Automate your indexing with [ShowUpInAI](https://showupinai.com/) (3-day free trial)
- Learn advanced [automation patterns](/blog/guide/agents/agent-patterns) to scale GEO content creation

The AI search revolution is already here. Get cited or get ignored.
