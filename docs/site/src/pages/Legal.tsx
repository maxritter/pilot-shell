      <p className="lg-lead">
        Your code, plans and task documents stay on your computer. Code your team reviews travels only to your own Git remote. QualityLayer receives only what you share with your team (a review comment can quote a few lines of code), a daily licence check, and reports you choose to send. What you share is encrypted on your computer first; we cannot read it.
      </p>

      <h2>Who is responsible</h2>
      <p>
        {SELLER.name}, {SELLER.street}, {SELLER.city}, {SELLER.country}, <Mail />. More in the <Link to="/imprint">imprint</Link>.
      </p>

      <h2>Visiting this website</h2>
      <p>
        Vercel Inc. (USA) serves the website and our API from Frankfurt. Each request carries your IP address, the page, the time and your browser; Vercel keeps these logs briefly to deliver and protect the service (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). Vercel Web Analytics counts page views without cookies and without identifying you (Art. 6 (1) (f)).
      </p>
      <p>
        We set only the cookies a function needs: a sign-in cookie for Billing (1 hour) and one while a team owner connects Slack (10 minutes). No tracking or advertising cookies (§ 25 (2) TDDDG).
      </p>

      <h2>Licence check and trial</h2>
      <p>
        The App checks your licence once a day. It sends your licence key, the activation and a code for this computer to our API, which asks Polar, our licence provider (Art. 6 (1) (b)). For a free trial we keep a one-way hash of the computer's code, so each computer gets one trial (Art. 6 (1) (f)). The App sends no usage events.
      </p>

      <h2>Buying and billing</h2>
      <p>
        Polar Software, Inc. sells QualityLayer as merchant of record. It processes your payment, invoices and taxes as its own controller, under Polar's privacy policy. To sign you in to Billing, we e-mail you a one-time code through Resend, Inc. (USA); the code is kept for 10 minutes (Art. 6 (1) (b)).
      </p>

      <h2>Sharing with your team</h2>
      <p>
        On a Team plan you can share tasks, plans, comments, artifacts and files. They are encrypted on your computer with your team's key, so we store only ciphertext. To route them we also store your team members' names and e-mail addresses from Polar, task names and steps, who asked whom, who read which version, and each computer's public key (Art. 6 (1) (b)).
      </p>
      <p>
        Review code travels between your computer and your own Git remote. When you click Ask for review, QualityLayer pushes the task's branch to your team's Git remote, and teammates with access to it read the code there. We store your team's comments on lines of code, the short lines of code they quote (up to 300 characters each) and the repository, branch and commits they point to. All of it is encrypted on your computer with your team's key. Apart from those quoted lines, we never receive the code.
      </p>
      <table className="lg-table">

          <tr><th>Service</th><th>What it holds</th><th>Where</th></tr>

        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        A shared task stays until its owner stops sharing it. When a team's subscription ends, its data is deleted after {RETENTION_DAYS} days. Encrypted backups are kept in the EU for {RETENTION_DAYS} days.
      </p>
      <h3>Share links</h3>
      <p>A link's content is sealed with a key that sits after the # in the link and never reaches our server. Links and the comments on them end after 14 days.</p>
      <h3>Slack</h3>
      <p>If a team owner connects Slack, the task title and the question are sent to Slack Technologies (USA) to deliver the message. The waiting message is sealed and deleted after 72 hours.</p>

      <h2>Feedback reports</h2>
      <p>
        When you send a report from the App, it contains your text, your name and e-mail, the diagnostics you can read before sending, and any screenshots you attach. It becomes an issue in our private GitHub repository (GitHub, Inc., USA) without your name and e-mail, and an e-mail to us through Resend that includes them. Screenshots are stored in Cloudflare R2 and deleted after 90 days (Art. 6 (1) (f): handling your report).
      </p>

      <h2>E-mail</h2>
      <p>If you write to us, we use your message to answer it and keep the conversation as long as it is needed (Art. 6 (1) (b) or (f)).</p>

      <h2>Recipients outside the EU</h2>
      <p>
        Vercel, Cloudflare, GitHub, Resend, Slack and Polar may process data in the USA. Transfers rely on the EU–US Data Privacy Framework where the provider is certified, and otherwise on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. Vercel, Neon, Upstash, Cloudflare and Resend process data for us under their data processing agreements. GitHub keeps the feedback issues, which hold no name or e-mail, under its own terms. Polar, as merchant of record, and Slack, in your team's own workspace, are responsible for the data they receive.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        You can ask for access, correction, deletion, restriction and a copy of your data, and object to processing based on our legitimate interest (Art. 15–21 GDPR). Write to <Mail />. You can also complain to a supervisory authority, for example the Bayerisches Landesamt für Datenschutzaufsicht, Promenade 18, 91522 Ansbach.
      </p>
      <p>We make no automated decisions about you and build no profiles. We update this page when the service changes; the date at the top says when.</p>

function Terms() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Terms of service</h1>
      <Updated />

      <h2>1. Who and what</h2>
      <p>
        These terms cover qualitylayer.dev, the QualityLayer App and CLI, and the team service, offered by {SELLER.name} (see the <Link to="/imprint">imprint</Link>). The{" "}
        <a href={`${GITHUB_URL}/blob/main/LICENSE`}>QualityLayer Software License Agreement</a> grants the licence to the software. Where the two differ, these terms apply to the team service and to liability.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Buying</h2>
      <p>Polar Software, Inc. sells subscriptions as merchant of record. Polar's terms apply to payment, invoices, taxes, renewals and refunds, and to a consumer's right of withdrawal.</p>

      <h2>3. Trial</h2>
      <p>You can try QualityLayer for 7 days without paying, once per computer.</p>

      <h2>4. Subscription</h2>
      <p>A subscription renews every month or year until you cancel it. You can cancel at any time in <Link to="/billing">Billing</Link>; it ends with the paid period. On a Team plan the team owner manages seats.</p>

      <h2>5. The team service</h2>
      <p>
        We run the team service with care but cannot promise it is always available; maintenance and faults can interrupt it. Shared content is encrypted with keys only your team's computers hold: if every computer of a team loses the key, we cannot recover the content. When a subscription ends, its team data is deleted after {RETENTION_DAYS} days.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Your part</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep your licence key to yourself and your team.</li>
        <li>Share only content you may share, and use the service lawfully.</li>
        <li>Do not attack, overload or work around the service's limits or licence checks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Liability</h2>
      <p>
        We are liable without limit for intent and gross negligence, for injury to life, body or health, under the Product Liability Act and under any guarantee we give. For slight negligence we are liable only when we breach an obligation that makes the contract possible and on which you may rely, and only for the damage that was typical and foreseeable when the contract was made. Otherwise we are not liable for slight negligence. For lost data we are liable only for what restoring it from your own regular backups would have cost.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes to these terms</h2>
      <p>We tell you by e-mail at least 30 days before a change takes effect. If you do not agree, you can cancel before then.</p>

      <h2>9. Law and courts</h2>
      <p>
        German law applies, without the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Consumers in the EU keep the protection of their own country's mandatory law. If you are a merchant, a legal entity under public law, or have no general place of jurisdiction in Germany, the courts at our place of business decide disputes.
