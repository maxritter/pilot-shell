"""Stop guard for /spec workflow - prevents early finishing when plan is active.

Only allows stopping when:
1. Asking user for plan approval (AskUserQuestion tool)
2. Asking user for an important decision (AskUserQuestion tool)
3. No active plan exists (not in /spec mode)
4. A fresh pause sentinel applies to the plan's current state - the approval wait,
   the configured main-session Manual model-switch handoff, a /build hand-back, or
   a verify-phase gate. The Manual gate is the only sentinel allowed for an
   approved PENDING plan, and only when the launcher already bound it to that exact
   plan before implementation. The other sentinels are qualified away from the
   implement phase.
5. A plan-bound durable interaction state is paused. UserPromptSubmit owns the
   human/synthetic distinction, and the pause remains authoritative even when
   `stop_hook_active` still describes an enclosing continuation chain. Buildouts
   never honor interaction pauses.
6. User stops again within 60s cooldown (escape hatch) - withheld while
   `stop_hook_active` marks the attempt as the agent's own continuation
7. Runaway cap: after MAX_BLOCKS blocks for the same plan with no user-question
   turn in between, OR MAX_CHAIN_BLOCKS blocks inside one continuation chain,
   emit one escalation block instructing the agent to AskUserQuestion. The next
   block-attempt after escalation is allowed through, breaking pathological
   infinite verify->implement loops. The per-chain bound is the one that matters
   on Claude Code, which silently ends the turn itself after
   CLAUDE_CODE_CONSECUTIVE_BLOCK_CAP consecutive blocks; the session-wide bound
   is the backstop for agents that report no continuation state.

`stop_hook_active` is deliberately NOT a reason to allow a stop: it is true for
every stop attempt after this guard blocks, so honoring it let the guard block
only once per continuation chain and left /build loops free to end mid-round.
