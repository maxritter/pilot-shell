"""Stop guard for /spec workflow - prevents early finishing when plan is active.

Only allows stopping when:
1. Asking user for plan approval (AskUserQuestion tool)
2. Asking user for an important decision (AskUserQuestion tool)
3. No active plan exists (not in /spec mode)
4. A fresh pause sentinel applies to the plan's current state - the approval wait,
   a /build hand-back, or a verify-phase gate. These are the path for agents that
   cannot emit AskUserQuestion (Codex, and Claude Code subagents dispatched as
   orchestration lanes), which would otherwise answer their own gate rather than
   stop. NONE of them applies to an approved PENDING plan: the implement phase has
   no legal pause (see the note where the retired manual-switch sentinel was).
5. User stops again within 60s cooldown (escape hatch) - withheld while
   `stop_hook_active` marks the attempt as the agent's own continuation
6. Runaway cap: after MAX_BLOCKS blocks for the same plan with no user-question
   turn in between, OR MAX_CHAIN_BLOCKS blocks inside one continuation chain,
   emit one escalation block instructing the agent to AskUserQuestion. The next
   block-attempt after escalation is allowed through, breaking pathological
   infinite verify->implement loops. The per-chain bound is the one that matters
   on Claude Code, which silently ends the turn itself after
   CLAUDE_CODE_CONSECUTIVE_BLOCK_CAP consecutive blocks; the session-wide bound
   is the backstop for agents that report no continuation state.

`stop_hook_active` is deliberately NOT a reason to allow a stop: it is true for
every stop attempt after this guard blocks, so honoring it let the guard block
only once per continuation chain and left /build loops free to end mid-round.
