"""Track EnterPlanMode/ExitPlanMode state via a session-scoped sentinel file.

Registered as:
  PostToolUse(EnterPlanMode) -> writes the sentinel
  PostToolUse(ExitPlanMode)  -> deletes the sentinel
  PreToolUse(Edit|Write|MultiEdit) -> injects a warning if the sentinel is active
                                      and the target file is not a plan doc;
                                      for plan-doc writes, verifies the observed
                                      planning-leg model (see below)

The sentinel lives at:
  ~/.pilot/sessions/<session_id>/plan-mode-active

Purpose: ensure spec-implement never runs on Opus because ExitPlanMode was
accidentally skipped. The warning gives the model one last chance to call
ExitPlanMode before touching implementation files. Plan mode is only entered
by /spec in AUTOMATED Model Switching mode; Manual/Off never toggle it.

Planning-leg model check (Automated mode only): plan mode under opusplan
must run on Opus - but Claude Code can silently serve the Sonnet leg instead
(Opus usage-limit fallback, a conversation grown past the plan leg's
effective ~200K window - currently even with the Opus 1M entitlement, an
upstream regression (anthropics/claude-code#65512) - or the session was
never on the opusplan model). EnterPlanMode itself cannot observe this (the statusline has
not re-rendered in the new mode yet), so the check runs once the statusline
cache carries a post-lever render (cache mtime > sentinel mtime), whose
model_id is authoritative. Both outcomes are injected once per planning leg:
a mismatch warning so the workflow reports the real model instead of narrating
an unverified "switched to Opus", and an Opus confirmation so a switch that DID
work is visible. Claude Code prints nothing either way -- there is no "switching
to Opus" message in any 2.1.x build, and the skip conditions log at `warn` level
-- so warning-only left a working switch indistinguishable from a broken one.

The check is exposed as `planning_leg_model_context` because the plan-doc
write is far too rare an anchor on its own: the plan file is written right
after EnterPlanMode (while the cache-mtime gate still suppresses the check)
and then left alone while the model explores -- which is exactly when the
conversation crosses 200K and the downgrade happens. `context_monitor` runs
it on every tool call so the flip is caught in the turn it occurs.

    Fires at most once per planning leg PER OUTCOME, and only on evidence: the
    statusline cache must carry a render newer than the EnterPlanMode sentinel
    (an older render still shows the pre-lever leg and proves nothing). Opus is
    the only expected leg (Automated's pair is fixed); anything else -- Sonnet,
    Haiku, even a Fable render -- means the opusplan plan-mode switch did not
    take effect.

    Both outcomes are reported because Claude Code itself prints nothing either
    way: the opusplan upgrade is silent on success (there is no "switching to
    Opus" message in any 2.1.x build) and its skip conditions log at `warn`
    level, invisible in the UI. Reporting only the failure left a working switch
    indistinguishable from a broken one, which users read as the switch failing.

    Separate markers per outcome keep the mid-planning downgrade catchable: a
    leg confirmed on Opus that later crosses 200K still gets its warning. Each
    marker is claimed with an exclusive create, not check-then-write, because
    parallel tool calls put several hook processes on this line at once.

    Called from two anchors: the plan-doc write below, and every tool call via
    `context_monitor` (see that hook's `_planning_leg_notice`). The downgrade
    lands mid-exploration, when the plan file has not been touched for a while,
