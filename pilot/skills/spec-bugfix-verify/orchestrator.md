# /spec-bugfix-verify - Bugfix Verification Phase

**Phase 3 (bugfix).** Lightweight verification: run tests, quality checks, confirm fix works end-to-end.

**Input:** Bugfix plan with `Status: COMPLETE`
**Output:** Plan → VERIFIED (success) or loop back to implementation (failure)

Choose the verification topology autonomously and sparingly. Keep verification in the current agent by default; add the minimum number of agents only for genuinely independent checks whose output would materially flood the main context, and avoid nesting unless a flat assignment cannot represent the work. Do not ask the user for delegation permission. The final verdict still cites the reproducing test, full suite, and end-to-end evidence regardless of which agent collected it.

## Critical Constraints

- **No delegation permission gate** — apply the bounded delegation criteria yourself and continue automatically; coordinate ownership and consolidate any delegated evidence into one verdict.
- **NO stopping** — everything automatic. Never ask "Should I fix these?"
- **Fix ALL issues automatically** — no permission needed
- **Plan file is source of truth** — re-read after auto-compaction
- ⛔ **NEVER claim VERIFIED on tests alone.** Step 1.6 (non-UI) and Step 3 (UI Verification Scenario) require running the actual program — Chrome / Chrome DevTools MCP / playwright-cli / agent-browser for UI; CLI / API / REPL for non-UI. Skip is never an option.
