## Step 1: Verify the Fix — Behavior Contract Audit

Audits that the process was followed. A retroactive test that passes proves nothing.

### 1.0 Run Full Test Suite (Baseline)

Confirm the repository's required suite passed against the current code. Reuse the implementation Quality Gate result if its inputs are unchanged; otherwise run it. Fix failures caused by the change, and distinguish proven pre-existing unrelated failures without expanding scope.

### 1.1 Read the plan

Read: `## Behavior Contract`, Task 1's `Entry point:` and test file/name, `Root Cause: file:line` from the summary.

If `## Behavior Contract` is missing (older plan): reconstruct from Summary + Fix Approach and add it to the plan before continuing.

### 1.2 Run the reproducing test

```bash
uv run pytest <test-path>::<test-name> -q   # or language-appropriate equivalent
```

Must PASS. If not, fix is incomplete — fix immediately.

### 1.3 Prove the test is a genuine RED

A passing regression test must distinguish the original bug from the fix. Reuse the recorded pre-fix RED from implementation when it identifies the exact test, pre-fix state, and documented failure, and the test has not since changed in a way that invalidates that evidence.

When that evidence is missing or stale, run the current regression test against a verified pre-fix snapshot in an isolated temporary checkout or copy. Include the fixtures and dependencies the test requires. Never overwrite, restore, or stash the active worktree's source merely to reconstruct the bug, and do not guess that the latest file commit's parent is the pre-fix state.

- Failure with the documented `Currently (bug)` behavior proves RED.
- A pass without the fix means the test does not distinguish the bug; improve the regression coverage before proceeding.
- An unrelated import, fixture, or setup error is not RED evidence. Resolve the environment or report the missing evidence.
- Restore only the isolated resources this check created; preserve concurrent work.

### 1.4 Root-cause + scope audit

**Resolve the diff base once with the resolver** — ⛔ do NOT derive it by hand:

> **`$LANE_FLAG`** is `--lane <id>` when this run was dispatched as an orchestration lane, and **nothing at all** otherwise — the value the invocation parsed from its arguments. It keeps worktree and plan identity scoped to this lane; an unflagged call resolves a different identity and silently finds nothing (issue #174).

```bash
SCOPE=$(~/.pilot/bin/pilot review-scope --slug <plan-slug> $LANE_FLAG --json 2>/dev/null \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d["diff_range"]); print(d.get("warning",""))' 2>/dev/null)
DIFF=$(printf '%s' "$SCOPE" | head -1)
printf '%s' "$SCOPE" | tail -n +2 | grep . && echo "^ scope degraded - fix this before trusting the checks below"
[ -n "$DIFF" ] || DIFF=HEAD   # older pilot binary: resolve by hand if the fix is worktree-committed
```

⛔ **`$LANE_FLAG` is load-bearing, and a `warning` is a stop sign.** A lane's branch is `spec/<slug>-<lane>`, so an unflagged resolve finds nothing and degrades to `git diff HEAD` — empty when the fix is committed on the worktree branch, so rule 1 below would fire on a diff that was never read (issue #176). Resolve the warning and re-run; do not check against the degraded scope.

⛔ Pipe through `--json` + a parse — do NOT use `... 2>/dev/null || echo HEAD`. A `pilot` binary predating `review-scope` does not fail on it: it prints the "runs directly inside Claude Code" transition banner and exits **0**, so `||` never fires and `$DIFF` silently becomes the banner text. The `json.load` parse fails on that banner, so the fallback actually runs.

That yields `HEAD` when the fix is UNCOMMITTED in the working tree (the default), and `<base_branch>...HEAD` when it is per-task-committed in a worktree. A committed ref-range in the uncommitted case shows nothing and would falsely fire rule 1 every run; a two-dot range in the worktree case would fold the base branch's own post-fork commits into this diff **inverted** — a base-branch addition reading as a deletion the fix never made — silently corrupting both the root-cause check and the scope check below. `pilot review-scope` encodes both rules; see `launcher/worktree.py:resolve_review_scope`.

```bash
git diff --name-only $DIFF
```

1. **Root-cause file MUST be in the diff.** If not, fix is at symptom — follow Step 7's failed-verification flow to correct the implementation automatically by default.
2. **Symptom-patching smells:** new broad `try/except` around the failing call, `if value is None: return default` at the caller when the bug is upstream, swallowed exceptions, silently normalised bad inputs, early returns hiding wrong state, renamed/suppressed log lines. Record + justify in Investigation, or revert.
3. **Scope check:** diff matches plan scope (Task 1 tests + Task 2 root-cause file ± documented defense-in-depth). Unplanned changes belong elsewhere — revert or extend the plan.

### 1.5 Instrumentation cleanup

```bash
if git diff $DIFF | grep -n "SPEC-DEBUG"; then
    echo "Temporary debug markers present — remove before continuing"
    exit 1
fi
```

Zero matches = clean. Any match = remove and re-run. Unmarked `console.log`/`print` additions are also suspect — inspect, justify, or remove.

### 1.6 Original symptom re-check — MANDATORY end-to-end verification

⛔ **The regression test passing does NOT prove the bug is fixed.** Unit tests can sit below the user's layer. A green test plus a still-broken app is the most common "fixed but not really" failure mode. You MUST run the actual program with the original input and observe the symptom is gone.

**Skip is NOT an option.** Capture concrete evidence (command, output, page state, status code) — bare assertions are insufficient.

Re-run the original repro from `## Summary — Trigger:` using the matching lane:

| Bug surface | What to run | Evidence to capture |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **CLI** | The exact command the user ran | Command + relevant output lines + exit code |
| **API** | `curl` / HTTP client with the user's input | Status code + the field/value that proves the fix |
| **Library / SDK / function** | `python -c '...'`, `node -e '...'`, REPL, or scratch script | Invocation + returned value |
| **Background job / cron / worker** | Trigger the job manually with the failing input | Run + log lines |
| **UI** | **Skip here — handled by Step 3 (Verification Scenario)** with browser automation — the driver the project's rules name, else the 4-tier ladder, per `browser-automation.md` | — |

**If the regression test passes but the original repro still fails:** test is at the wrong layer. Note "test green but original repro still fails — layer mismatch" and follow Step 7's failed-verification flow to rewrite Task 1's test at the user's entry point.

**If the running program is unavailable** (build broken, infra missing, integration env down): diagnose and resolve what the authorized scope permits, continue independent checks, and follow Step 7's failed-verification flow if a true blocker needs user input. A build or service still starting requires autonomous waiting on its live handle. Keep the plan unverified until the actual program has been checked.
