## Step 1: Process Overview

```
Phase A — Finalize the code:
  Launch Reviewer → Automated Checks (tests + lint + verify commands) → Feature Parity (if migration) → Collect Review Results → Fix

Phase B — Verify the running program (depth depends on runtime profile):
  Build → Program Execution → Per-Task DoD Audit → E2E

Final:
  Regression check → Worktree sync → Post-merge verification → Update status
```
