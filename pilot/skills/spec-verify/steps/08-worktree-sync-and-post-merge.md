## Step 8: Worktree Sync & Post-Merge Verification (if worktree active)

### 8.1 Worktree Sync

1. Extract plan slug from path (strip date prefix and `.md`)

2. Check: `~/.pilot/bin/pilot worktree detect --json <plan_slug> $LANE_FLAG`

3. **If no worktree:** Skip to Step 9 (the annotation check — it runs BEFORE the review gate regardless of worktree mode; never collapse Step 9 → Step 10).

4. **Save plan to project root** (only if gitignored):
   ```bash
   git -C <project_root> check-ignore -q docs/plans/<plan_filename>
   ```
   If exit 0 (ignored): `cp <worktree_plan_path> <project_root>/docs/plans/<plan_filename>`
   If exit 1 (tracked): skip — the squash merge will bring the updated plan.

5. **Show diff:** `~/.pilot/bin/pilot worktree diff --json <plan_slug> $LANE_FLAG`

6. **Notify and ask:**
   ```bash
   ~/.pilot/bin/pilot notify plan_approval "Worktree Sync" "<plan_name> — approve merge" --plan-path "<plan_path>" 2>/dev/null || true
   ```
   AskUserQuestion: "Yes, squash merge" (Recommended) | "No, keep worktree" | "Discard all changes"

   ⛔ **When you cannot emit `AskUserQuestion`** — on Codex, where it renders as a plain-text list rather than an interactive control, or as a Claude Code subagent running this plan as an orchestration lane, where the tool is absent entirely — the prompt above will not block for an answer, so you must yield yourself. Read `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/agents/agent-gate-protocol.md` and follow it, supplying `GATE_NAME` = `Worktree sync`, `OPTIONS` = the three above, `SENTINEL_PATH` = `verify-gate-pending`:

   ```bash
   SESS_DIR="$HOME/.pilot/sessions/${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:-${CODEX_THREAD_ID:-${PILOT_SESSION_ID:-default}}}"
   mkdir -p "$SESS_DIR" && touch "$SESS_DIR/verify-gate-pending"
   ```

   Then **end your turn**. The stop guard honours this sentinel once for an approved plan at `Status: COMPLETE`, so the user can answer. Treat their NEXT message as the choice. ⛔ Do NOT run the sync in the same turn — this gate guards a squash merge onto the base branch, which is the one decision in the workflow that cannot be undone by asking again. On resume, delete the sentinel first, then act on their choice:

   ```bash
   rm -f "$SESS_DIR/verify-gate-pending"
   ```

   The sentinel is consumed when honoured, so **re-touch it** every time you come back here and ask again.

7. **Handle choice:**

   **Squash merge:**
   ```bash
   # ⛔ ALL THREE operations MUST be in ONE Bash call chained with &&
   # If sync fails, cleanup MUST NOT run — otherwise work is lost.
   ~/.pilot/bin/pilot worktree sync --json <plan_slug> $LANE_FLAG && PROJECT_ROOT=$(~/.pilot/bin/pilot worktree cleanup --force --json <plan_slug> $LANE_FLAG | jq -r '.project_root') && cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"
   ```
   ⛔ NEVER split sync, cleanup, or cd into separate Bash calls — compaction between them can cause work loss.
   ⛔ The `&&` chain ensures cleanup only runs after a successful sync.

   **Exit codes.** `0` clean · `1` nothing landed · **`2` the squash landed but the base checkout's own uncommitted work could not be restored** and is sitting in `git stash list`. The chain stops on 2 by itself, deliberately leaving the worktree in place. Do NOT re-run cleanup to "finish the job": surface the JSON's `stash_warning` and the `git stash pop` recovery to the user first. `success: true` is still correct — the merge landed; only the unrelated local work is stranded.

   **Lane contention.** Sync serializes on a repo-wide lock, so a concurrent lane's sync waits instead of interleaving its merge into the shared base checkout. A failure naming lane contention means another lane held the lock past the timeout and **nothing was changed** — retry once it finishes.

   **Keep worktree:** Report path, user can sync later. Skip 8.2 below.
   **Discard:** `~/.pilot/bin/pilot worktree cleanup --discard --json <plan_slug> $LANE_FLAG` + `cd` in same bash call (no sync needed — `--discard` explicitly allows deleting unmerged work). Skip 8.2 below. ⛔ `$LANE_FLAG` here too: an unflagged discard resolves a different worktree identity and silently no-ops, leaving the lane's checkout behind.

### 8.2 Post-Merge Verification (after squash merge only)

**Mandatory after successful squash merge.** The squash merge can introduce breakage from base branch divergence.

1. Run full test suite
2. Run type checker / linter
3. Build verification
4. Program launch smoke test

If any fails: fix on base branch, re-run, commit fix separately (e.g., `fix: resolve post-merge regression from spec/<slug>`).

**⛔ Do NOT proceed to Step 10 until all post-merge checks pass.**
