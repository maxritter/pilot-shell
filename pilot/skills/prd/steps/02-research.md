## Step 2: Research (Optional)

<!-- CC-ONLY -->
**After understanding the idea, ask the user which research tier they want.** Use `AskUserQuestion` with these options:
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->
<!-- CODEX-START
**Codex default:** choose Quick unless the user explicitly asked for research or the PRD depends on current external facts. If research is needed, ask one plain-text tier question with these options:
CODEX-END -->

- **Quick (Recommended for simple ideas)** — "Skip research, go straight to brainstorming or clarification"
- **Standard** — "Light in-session web research: competitors, prior art, best practices (5-10 searches, stays in this conversation)"
- **Deep** — "Full multi-angle research with source verification and a cited report (higher token cost)"

### Quick Tier

Skip web research. Proceed to Step 3 (Ideate) if the idea is still vague and would benefit from brainstorming; otherwise go straight to Step 4 (Clarify).

### Standard Tier

1. **Generate 5-8 search queries** based on the topic:
   - Competitor/alternative analysis ("alternatives to X", "X vs Y")
   - Prior art and existing solutions ("how companies solve X")
   - Technical approaches ("best practices for X")
   - User experience patterns ("UX patterns for X")
<!-- CC-ONLY -->
2. **Discover web-search tool:** `ToolSearch(query="+web-search search")`
3. **Execute searches sequentially**, gathering key findings from each
4. **Optionally fetch full pages** for promising results: `ToolSearch(query="+web-fetch fetch")` then `fetch_url(url="...")`
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->
<!-- CODEX-START
2. **Use the web tools exposed in the current Codex schema.** Follow their actual names and parameter schemas; do not assume a specific MCP namespace.
3. **Batch independent searches when the tool supports it**, gathering key findings from each.
4. **Fetch full pages selectively** for promising results with the available fetch/open capability.
CODEX-END -->
5. **Compile research summary:**
   - Key findings (3-5 bullet points)
   - Sources with links
   - Trade-offs and patterns discovered
   - Gaps or areas needing more exploration
6. **Present summary to user** before proceeding to ideation (Step 3) or clarification (Step 4)

### Deep Tier

<!-- CC-ONLY -->
Deep research is owned by the dedicated **`deep-research` skill** — a harness that decomposes the question into multiple angles, fans out parallel web searches, fetches and de-duplicates sources, adversarially verifies each claim, and synthesizes a cited report. Do **not** run searches or spawn your own sub-agents here; hand the whole research loop to the skill.

1. **Compose a focused research question** from the idea plus everything learned in Step 1 — weave in the concrete constraints, stack, audience, and context you've gathered so the research is scoped, not generic. A sharp, specific question is the single biggest driver of report quality.
2. **Invoke the skill:**
   ```
   Skill(skill="deep-research", args="<focused research question, constraints woven in>")
   ```
   - The skill may ask 2-3 clarifying questions if scope is still broad — answer them from PRD context where you can, otherwise relay them to the user.
   - It runs a multi-agent workflow (higher token cost) and returns a cited, fact-checked report.
3. **If the skill is unavailable or its run fails,** fall back to the **Standard tier** above (in-session web search) so research still happens — never silently skip it.
4. **Synthesize the returned report** into the research summary, preserving source links and any confidence/caveat notes.

**Cap:** none needed — the `deep-research` skill manages its own breadth and token budget.
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->
<!-- CODEX-START
Deep research in Codex uses bounded parallel angles when agent tools are exposed, with a direct in-session fallback:

1. **Generate a research outline** with 2-3 research angles based on the topic. Examples:
   - "Competitor landscape" — what exists, market positioning, pricing
   - "Technical approaches" — architectures, frameworks, implementation patterns
   - "User experience" — UX patterns, onboarding flows, common pain points
2. **Assign independent angles.** When the current Codex schema exposes agent tools, dispatch one bounded research agent per angle in parallel. Give each an exclusive question, the same source-quality rules, and a required cited findings format. Otherwise research the angles directly. For each angle:
   - Execute 2-3 targeted searches
   - Optionally fetch full pages for promising results via the available fetch/open capability
   - Compile findings per angle
3. **Collect and synthesize.** Keep returned agent ids and wait using the current tool schema. Verify citations before synthesizing findings across all angles into one research summary.

**Codex cap:** at most 2 research angles with 2-3 searches each unless the user explicitly asks for exhaustive research.
CODEX-END -->

**Then (both agents):** present the synthesized findings to the user — organized by source/angle, key insights and caveats highlighted — before proceeding to ideation (Step 3) or clarification (Step 4).

### Research Output

When research was performed (Standard or Deep), the findings are embedded in the PRD under a `## Research Findings` section after Key Decisions.
